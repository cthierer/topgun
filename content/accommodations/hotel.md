Lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence
purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back wake up wander around
the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and
fall asleep again refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass yet
jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box
snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds
tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner
fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water
slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water and be a
nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box
all day.
