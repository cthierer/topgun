Out of respect for the ceremony, please do not take photos during the ceremony
or during the photographerâ€™s session with the wedding party immediately
following the ceremony.

Nothing ruins a wedding photo like someone leaning out in the aisle to take a
picture with their cell phone or camera. All professional photos taken by our
photographer will be available after the wedding. Photos will be uploaded to
our website, unwatermarked and in full resolution. Please feel free to download
them at that time. We encourage you to take photos during the reception and
post them to our website for everyone to see!
