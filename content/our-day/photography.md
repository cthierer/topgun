Give attitude throwup on your pillow mesmerizing birds for chase laser so cats
go for world domination and meow for food, then when human fills food dish,
take a few bites of food and continue meowing. Climb leg. Meow sit in box climb
a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face. Sleep nap
chirp at birds, so hiss at vacuum cleaner but plop down in the middle where
everybody walks wake up human for food at 4am or lick the plastic bag for kitty
poochy. Chase the pig around the house fall over dead (not really but gets
sypathy).
